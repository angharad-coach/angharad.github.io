					<h4>My Story</h4>
					<p>I grew up in the Welsh countryside, and living on a dairy farm experienced farm-to-fork living from an early age. Immersion in this environment cultivated a deep curiosity of the relationship we all have with our food. These formative years led me to study Food &amp; Nutrition at University.</p>
					<p>Despite qualifying as a nutritionist, an early adult life full of excess led to me suffering for many years with chronic fatigue, mental health struggles and food sensitivities. Only to be told by every doctor I visited that I was suffering from IBS.</p>
					<p>Refusal to accept this diagnosis started my personal health journey – I wanted to feel good, and most of all I wanted to make sure that the lifestyle choices I made today were setting my mind and body up for a full and healthy future. </p>

					<p>Gut health science was in its infancy whilst I was studying my degree so I began researching independently and making incremental changes to my own lifestyle based on what I was learning. After years of research, tweaking my lifestyle as I learnt,  I discovered that my migraines and subsequent IBS diagnosis were triggered by stress. Despite gut and microbiome science still being relatively new at the time, through applying what I learnt in this area I was able to bring my health issues under control and instilled new lifestyle habits that still serve me today.  </p>
					<p>My own transformation led me to formally train as a health &amp; lifestyle coach so that I could inspire others to make small but powerful changes to their own lives everyday. As a nutritionist I had the knowledge to confidently consult on dietary changes, however it was necessary for me to develop an understanding of the techniques required to achieve a habit and mental shift. Often clients understand what a healthy diet consists of, however our eating is heavily influenced by certain mental triggers and lifestyle choices. Now I’m equipped to teach people how to connect with their intuition and understand what food gives them energy, and what food takes that same energy away, and at the same time provide them with the tools needed to implement dietary changes in a sustainable way. </p>
					<p>My ultimate goal is to understand what is unique in each of my client’s lifestyles and guide them on a path to creating their healthiest and happiest lives.</p>

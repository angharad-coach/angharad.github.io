  quote: In a gentle and compassionate manner, Angharad helped me to uncover the roots of my challenges – a profound deep dive for me that has increased my self-awareness enormously. </em><em>I completed her programme and developed an unimaginable increase in energy, crystal clear focus, increased concentration and a new found capacity to hold myself compassionately, especially when old habits and emotions make a visit.
